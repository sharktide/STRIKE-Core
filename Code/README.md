This is the code used to train the ClimateNet models. 

Note: You may not be able to perfectly recreate the results of FireNet due to the random sampleing of the dataset. Download the model from [huggingface](https://hf.co/sharktide/FireNet) instead

Note: These assume the ``dataset/`` folder and ``models/`` folder are avalible under a relative path. You will have to either move these folders into ``Code`` or move your notebooks to the root directory.
