Today I focused a bit more on PV-FloodNet. I got a working version that is preforming okay, but I noticed something troubling: the rainfall gradient is vanishing. 

I even did a test and found out my rainfal gradient was less than 0.000001!

I now am a victim of the vanishing gradient problem!

I tried the following

- Processing rainfall seperatley
- Making residual connections
- Experimenting with sigmoid
- Adding modulation clipping
- Removing Normalization (yes i may be crazy)
- Ragequitting

NOTHING WORKED ARGIJSERJIhgujlnwtbuehtgletiouhnjrtlohugjoelneriohl

Then I looked at the training logs (jupyter notebook is ugly ok) 

I found guess what - 100% validation accuracy! I was confused until I realized the horrible realities of Deep Neural Networks and Synthetic Dataset Generation

- A validation accuracy of 100% is rarely good: it usually indicates a problem with your dataset
- I generated my dataset with NumPy
- No matter how much ranodm loc i did it didn't matter
- It didn't matter because I was not explictly having noise in the rainfall column
- The model learned that rainfall wasn't important because of the dataset
- Nothing i did with the architecture mattered because the dataset was fundametally horrible.

Anyway I fixed everything and now the gradient is alive and I even did a plot and some inference tests and its looking good! I put it in MISC/misc_code/plot.repy

I'll continue work tomorrow

Its preforming so well I don't think I need a TrustNet! However I think I'll make one anyway; tradition after all!
