I am going to make ClimateNet, like a family of models to predict natural disasters.

The thing that really drove me to work on this was seeing the fires in by our house in March/April. The LA Fires. The Denver Fires. The bay area fires that may be starting now... I have lived in SF, Denver, and am in Florida. 

This has got to stop. Thousands of Lives are at stake. Bilions of dollars are at stake. Tons of Carbon Dioxide are at stake.
